# Changelog

I'll try to track some of the changes done to the site in here.

## 06/10/2023 mainly styling

I'm trying to customize some features I don't like in the default style.

#### Heading colors

I don't like the default text color for headings in the Material for MkDocs design. It blends in too much with the other text and makes it hard to differentiate.

However going with dark-orange seems a bit too hard? I'll stick with this for now, because it works in the bright theme as well and is a nice contrast to the blueish accent color.

Maybe something gray will fit better.

#### Content-background

By default the background-color of the content (the whole section containing the text) is the same as the site-background. Again I felt it was somewhat confusing with the two tables-of-content left and right.
I chose a slightly brighter color and it's ok for me.

#### Added changelog

Duh
